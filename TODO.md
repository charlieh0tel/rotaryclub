# TODO

- File rotation for --dump-audio to bound disk usage on very long recordings
  (memory growth is fixed: dumps stream to disk incrementally)
- Add criterion benchmarks for DSP pipeline (FIR filters, AGC, I/Q correlation)
- Improve zero-crossing coherence metric (sub-window phase variance like correlation method)

## Bearing Calculator

- [ ] Chase the residual bearing error that remains once
      `north_tick_timing_adjustment` is zero: about 0.09 samples at 48 kHz
      and 0.25 at 96 kHz, sample-rate dependent, identical in the
      correlation and zero-crossing methods, so it is in the shared path
      rather than either estimator. Under 1.5 degrees. The north tracker is
      not the source; its own bias measures 0.001 samples.
- [ ] Express `north_tick_timing_adjustment` in microseconds rather than
      samples, so a calibration made at one sample rate holds at another.
